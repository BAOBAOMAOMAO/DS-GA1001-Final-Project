# DS-GA1001-Final-Project
A Portuguese bank institute plans to run phone marketing campaigns to persuade customers to subscribe
its term deposits. Success rate for such campaign is usually as low as 11%. Often, more than one contact
to the same clients is made. Making phone calls not only requires manpower, money and time, but also
has drawbacks including leading to negative customer attitudes and intrusion of customers’ privacy.
The bank wants an accurate model for targeting customers so that it can gain the constant support from
old customers and win term deposits market from new customers with minimized resources. The
business problem is whether it is possible to predict the outcome of phone calls based on prospects’
demographic information beforehand. It is important because then fewer numbers of contacts are needed
to achieve the same number of subscriptions.
